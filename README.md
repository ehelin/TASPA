# Taspa
Simply stated, this repository is the my next learning application.  Like <a href="https://github.com/ehelin/TgimbaNetCoreCloudNative">The Globe In My BucketList Application (TGIMBA)</a> before, I create fun projects to learn different technologies.  This effort is to have a tool that better helps me learn Spanish.
